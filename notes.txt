flex: 1   // use as much room as it again maximise space
object-fit: contain;   // make sure the image never looses aspect ratio when screen shrinks

parent align items center and using display flex means childen get this as well

make nav bar stick stay at top when scrolling 
.header {
  background-color: #131921;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  position: sticky; ///      better than fixed always stuck at top sticky gives better anim
  top: 0; ///
  z-index: 100; ///
